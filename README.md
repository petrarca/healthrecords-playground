# Sonnet

## Overview

Sonnet is a showcase application demonstrating techniques for building a modern electronic health records (EHR) and practice management system. This application highlights how AI-assisted development can create sophisticated healthcare applications with minimal manual coding. Most components, including the complex ones like patient record visualization, natural language assistant, and context-aware navigation, were generated by AI.

The application serves as a demonstration of state-of-the-art development practices, focusing on modularity, maintainability, and user experience.

> Note: Even this README documentation was mostly generated by AI, demonstrating how AI can assist with comprehensive documentation alongside code generation. Claude 3.5 / 3.7 Sonnet were primarily used for generating both the code and documentation in this project.

Despite being AI-generated, the codebase maintains high quality standards and has passed various quality gates including type checking, linting, and code style consistency checks. This demonstrates how AI-assisted development can produce production-ready code that adheres to best practices.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: React-based web application for the EHR system
- **Backend**: API services and database management

### Frontend

The frontend is a React 19 application with TypeScript, built with Vite. It includes:

- Main EHR application
- Developer portal with component documentation
- Experimental features

For detailed information about the frontend, see the [Frontend README](/frontend/README.md).

### Backend

The backend handles data storage and API services using Supabase.

## Database Setup

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Once your project is created, navigate to the SQL Editor in the Supabase dashboard
3. Execute the database schema:
   - Open the `db/schema.sql` file from this repository
   - Copy the contents and paste them into the SQL Editor
   - Run the query to create all necessary tables and functions
4. Load the test data:
   - Open the `db/test_data.sql` file from this repository
   - Copy the contents and paste them into the SQL Editor
   - Run the query to populate the database with sample patients and medical records
5. Get your Supabase URL and anon key:
   - Go to Project Settings > API
   - Copy the URL and anon key for the next step

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- pnpm (v8 or later)
- Supabase account (for database)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for the entire project
pnpm install

# Install dependencies for frontend and its subprojects
cd frontend
pnpm install-all
```

### Setting Up Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. To set up pre-commit:

1. Install pre-commit:
```bash
# Using pip
pip install pre-commit

# Or using Homebrew on macOS
brew install pre-commit
```

2. Install the git hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will set up the following hooks:
- Frontend linting and type checking on commit
- Frontend type checking on push

The pre-commit configuration is defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Contributing
